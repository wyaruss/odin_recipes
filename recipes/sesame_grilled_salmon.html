        <h2>You've been jammin' for a salmon, and I'm here to give it to ya.</h2>
        <p>In a world of dry, leathery, flavorless salmon, only one recipe can save the day, and it's this one 
            (I take no credit for this recipe--read the original by Emily <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237900/sesame-grilled-salmon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.)
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb salmon fillets</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps (as written by Emily)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk soy sauce, honey, ginger, and garlic together in a bowl until marinade is evenly mixed. Set aside 1/4 of the marinade.</li>
            <li>Place salmon fillets in a shallow dish; pour the remaining marinade over the salmon. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove salmon from marinade, shaking to remove excess marinade, and place, skin-side up, into the hot oil; cook for 4 minutes. 
                Discard unused marinade in the shallow dish. Flip salmon and drizzle the reserved marinade over salmon; sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip salmon, remove skin, and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        </ol>
