        <h2>A match made in heaven.</h2>
        <p>This might just be the ultimate stoner food, aside from how involved it is to make.

        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces hot Italian sausage, sliced</li>
            <li>12 ounces unbaked pizza dough, room temp</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cornmeal</li>
            <li>3/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>6 ounces shredded Fontina cheese, divided</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup baby arugula leaves, washed and dried</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps (as written by Carl Hanson)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prehead oven to 475 deg F (245 deg C).</li>
            <li>Cook and stir sliced Italian sausage in a skillet over medium heat until some of the fat has rendered out and sausage is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Roll pizza dough out to about 12 inches in diameter and about 3/8-inch thick; sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip dough so the cornmeal side is down and transfer to a perforated 14-inch pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Spread pizza sauce in a thin layer on top of the dough. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and about 3/4 the Fontina cheese. Spread sausage slices onto the pizza, leaving 4 spaces about 3 inches across on the pizza for eggs. Sprinkle remaining Fontina cheese onto sausage slices.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is hot, edges are starting to brown, and cheese has started to melt, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack each egg into a separate ramekin or small bowl. Remove pizza from oven and use a spatula to press the spaces between sausage slices flat. Gently pour an egg onto each space. Grind a little black pepper onto each egg yolk. Lightly sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over entire pizza.</li>
            <li>Return to oven and bake until eggs are set but yolks are still liquid, about 5 minutes, checking frequently to avoid overcooking eggs. Toss arugula leaves with olive oil in a bowl until coated. Remove pizza from oven, poke egg yolks with a fork, spread them around a little, and sprinkle arugula over the top of the pizza. Cut into 4 quarters, each with an egg, to serve.</li>
        </ol>
