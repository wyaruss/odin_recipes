# odin_recipes 

This project (completed as part of the Odin Project) was my first web dev-related project. It helped me learn the basics of HTML. 

Neither the recipes nor the photos are my own. Authors are credited on corresponding recipe pages. Original recipes are linked, and authors and photographers are credited within said links.
